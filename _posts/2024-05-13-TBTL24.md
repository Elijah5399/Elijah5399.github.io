TBTL CTF 2024 was a 48-hour long CTF Event organised by employees of Blockhouse Technology in Zagreb, Croatia from 11 May, 06:00AM SGT to 13 May, 06:00AM SGT. There were 7 crypto challenges, 5 misc challenges, 6 pwn challenges, 5 rev challenges and 4 web challenges. My team G04T3DP30PL3 solved 3 crypto challenges, 2 misc challenges, 1 pwn challenge, 1 rev challenge and 1 web challenge. This got us 47th place amongst 792 teams, earning us 6.996 rating points on [ctftime](https://ctftime.org/event/2324).

This writeup includes my workings for the 3 crypto challenges, 1 pwn challenge and 1 rev challenge which I solved.

## Fence Building (100 points)

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/fence_building.png" alt="Fence Building Challenge Description" style="width: 500px; height: 400px">

We are given a scrambled flag, and the challenge description hints that a fence cipher is being used.

We can use online tools such as [planetcalc](https://planetcalc.com/6947/) to decrypt the ciphertext. This gives us the flag if we use 4 rails: `TBTL{G00d_F3nce5_m4k3_g00D_n31ghb0ur5}`

## School Essay (100 points)

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/school_essay.png" alt="School Essay Challenge Description" style="width: 500px; height: 400px">

We are given the following Python script:

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from redacted import FLAG

ESSAY_TEMPLATE = """
My Favorite Classmate
=====================

My favorite person in this class has a beautiful smile,
great sense of humour, and lots of colorful notebooks.

However, their most distinctive feature is the fact that
you can represent their name as an integer value, square
it modulo %d,
and you'll get %d.

Additionally, When you compute the greatest integer not exceeding
the cube root of their squared name, you get %d.

By now, all of you have probably guessed who I'm talking about.
"""


def invpow3(x):
    lo, hi = 1, x
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2 + 1
        if (mid**3) <= x:
            lo = mid
        else:
            hi = mid - 1
    return lo


N = 59557942237937483757629838075432240015613811860811898821186897952866236010569299041278104165604573

name_int = bytes_to_long(FLAG)

assert 1 < name_int < N

value_1 = (name_int**2) % N
value_2 = invpow3(name_int**2)

print(ESSAY_TEMPLATE % (N, value_1, value_2))

```

We also know the result of the modulo operation and the smallest integer whose cube root does not exceed the message squared.

On checking using factordb, we find that N is a prime number. Hence we can use
the [Tonelli-Shanks algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm) to find the value of m.

I cloned [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZeroBone/TonelliShanks) and proceeded to input the value of $$a$$ and $$p$$.

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/school_essay_script.png" alt="School Essay Script Output" style="width: 700px; height: 300px">

Now that we have the roots, we can make a simple solve script to get the flag (I tried both roots):

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import *

print(long_to_bytes(703032588627510822704619969444615719158069204277139920487471397235396114708359092304587909772157))
```

This gives us the flag: `TBTL{J0hn_J4c0b_J1n6LeH31mer_Schmid7_<3}`

## Wikipedia Signatures (100 points)

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/wiki_signatures.png" alt="Wikipedia Signatures Challenge Description" style="width: 500px; height: 500px">

We are told that the problem involves digital signatures. We are also given the following script `server.py`:

```python

                myprint(f"{FLAG}")
                exit(0)
            else:
                myprint(f"Nope. Keep trying!")
        elif action == 2:

            myprint(sig)
        else:
            break


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Essentially, we are given a known plaintext, and challenged to sign it with the help of a signing oracle. The signing oracle, however, will not directly sign the plaintext for us. It will also not sign any multiples of the plaintext.

As it turns out, this is victim to an [existential forgery attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/mzv1q6/can_someone_explain_an_existential_forgery_attack/).

Let the RSA signing function be $$S$$. If we can factorise the message $$m$$ into two factors, say $$m = m_1m_2$$, then we would want $$S(m) = S(m_1m_2)$$. Expanding the signing function, $$S(m_1m_2) = (m_1m_2)^e mod\space n = (m_1^e mod\space n\times m_2^e mod\space n)mod\space n = (S(m_1)mod\space n \times S(m_2)mod\space n)mod\space n$$

So all we need to do is find at least 2 factors of $$m$$, get the oracle to sign the factors, then multiply the signed factors and perform modulo n. I used factordb to factorise $$m$$ into 3 factors: $$m_1$$, $$m_2$$ and $$m_3$$, then found their signed values $$s_1$$, $$s_2$$ and $$s_3$$, multiplied them and applied modulo $$n$$. I then submitted this as a signature and it was accepted. Below is the solve script:

```python
from Crypto.Util.number import bytes_to_long

TARGET = b'I challenge you to sign this message!'
'''
IDEA
We wish to forge the signature of TARGET, i.e. find S(TARGET)
S(TARGET) = pow(TARGET, d, N)
If we can factorise TARGET, i.e. TARGET = m1 * m2 * m3, we can get the signing oracle to compute
S(m1), S(m2) and S(m3).
S(TARGET) = S(m1 * m2 * m3) = pow(m1 * m2 * m3, d, N) = (pow(m1, d, N) * pow(m2, d, N) * pow(m3, d, N)) % N
= (S(m1) * S(m2) * S(m3)) % N

Submitting this as the signature gives us the flag: `TBTL{r3p347_4f73r_m3-d16174l_516n47ur3_15_n07_3ncryp710n}`

## Enough with the averages

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/enough_with_avg.png" alt="Enough with the averages Challenge Description" style="width: 500px; height: 500px">

We are given the following source code `chall.c`:

```c
// gcc -o chall chall.c -Wextra
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void read_flag() {
  FILE* in;
  char flag[64];
  in = fopen("flag.txt", "rt");
  fscanf(in, "%s", flag);
  fclose(in);
}

void vuln() {
  int score[20];
  int total = 0;
  for (int i=0; i<20; i++) {
    printf("Enter score for player %d:\n", i);
    scanf("%d", &score[i]);
    total += score[i];
  }
  printf("Average score is %lf.\n", total/20.);
  printf("Type q to quit.");
  while (getchar() != 'q');
}

int main() {
  setbuf(stdin, NULL);
  setbuf(stdout, NULL);
  read_flag();
  vuln();
  return 0;
}
```

When analysing the binary using `checksec`, we find that all protections are enabled on the binary. The architecture is amd64-64-little.

Basically the `main()` function is calling `read_flag()` which reads the flag file into an array of chars, and then calls `vuln()`. `vuln()` uses `scanf` to take in 20 integers which represent the player scores, then prints the average score before prompting the user to exit the program.

The main problem with this code is that if we enter a character to `scanf("%d", &score[i])` instead of an integer, the value at `&score[i]` is not changed. Entering a character will also cause subsequent `scanf` calls taking in an integer to be "skipped", until we read a character.

Analysing the code using Ghidra, we observe that the `local_58` variable which stores the flag's characters in the `read_flag()` function occupies the stack from `Stack[-0x58]` to `Stack[-0x11]` inclusive.

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/read_flag_ghidra.png" alt="Read flag function analysed in Ghidra" style="width: 1000px; height: 400px">

We also observe that the `local_68` variable in the `vuln()` function occupies the stack from `Stack[-0x68]` to `Stack[-0x11]` inclusive.

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/vuln_ghidra.png" alt="Vuln function analysed in Ghidra" style="width: 1000px; height: 400px">

We also know that the stack base pointers for `read_flag()` and `vuln()` are the same, since `vuln()` is called right after `read_flag()`.

For the first 4 players, we always give them a score of 0. This is because the first 16 bytes (or 4 integers) which the `vuln()` function accepts were not used to store the flag's characters. The remaining 16 integers, or 64 bytes (which is also 64 characters), in the stack were previously used to store the flag's characters.

The `vuln()` function will read 'blocks' of 1 integer (4 bytes) when calculating the average. In total, we have 16 'blocks' we want to find the characters of. We number these blocks from 0 to 15. Our strategy is as follows:

1. Maintain a cumulative sum of block values. I call this `cum`.
2. We set all blocks 0 to 14 to have an integer value of 0, and enter a character as the integer value of block 15. This causes `scanf` to "skip" the replacement of the characters at block 15.
3. Obtain the average of the 20 blocks, and multiply it by 20 to obtain the integer value of block 15 `res`.
4. Since the binary is little endian, the first character of the block is stored at the lowest byte while the last character of the block is stored at the highest byte. So the first character is the last 8 bits of `res`, the second character is the next 8 bits of `res`, the third character is the next 8 bits of `res` and the last character is the first 8 bits of `res`. This helps us obtain the last 4 characters of the flag which are located in block 15.
5. Increment the value of `cum` by `res`.
6. This time we set all blocks 0 to 13 to have an integer value of 0, and enter a character as the integer value of block 14. This causes `scanf` to "skip" the replacement of the characters at blocks 14 and 15.
7. Obtain the average of the 20 blocks, and multiply it by 20 to obtain the combined integer value of blocks 14 and 15.
8. The integer value of block 14, `res`, is this integer value with `cum` subtracted (recall that `cum` now has the value of block 15).
9. Increment `cum` by `res`.
10. Repeat step 4 to obtain the characters in block 14.
11. Repeat steps 6 - 10, successively decrementing the block at which we enter a character into `scanf("%d", &score[i])`. Doing so, we obtain the characters in all blocks.

Below is the Python script which implements this:

```python
from pwn import *

cum = 0
flag = ""
# iterate through "chunks" of 4 characters
for i in range(16):
    # p = process('./stats')
    p = remote('0.cloud.chals.io', 10198)
    # first 4 chunks do not contain the flag so set to 0 so
    # we don't include their value
    for _ in range(4):
        p.sendlineafter(b":\n", b'0')
    num_zeroes = 16 - i - 1
    for _ in range(num_zeroes):
        p.sendlineafter(b":\n", b'0')
    p.sendlineafter(b":\n", b'a')
    p.recvuntil(b'is ')
    res = p.recvuntil(b'.\n')
    info(res)
    p.close()
    res = res[:-2].decode()
    res = int(float(res) * 20)
    res -= cum
    cum += res
    a = chr(res % 256)
    res >>= 8
    b = chr(res % 256)
    res >>= 8
    c = chr(res % 256)
    res >>= 8
    d = chr(res % 256)
    flag = a + b + c + d + flag

print(f"flag: {flag}")
```

The script prints the flag for us, and the output is: `flag: TBTL{e4t_Y0ur_vegG13s_1n1714l1z3_y0ur_d4rn_v4r14bl35}\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00`

## Flagcheck (100 points)

<img src = "/assets/tbtl24/flagcheck.png" alt="Flagcheck Challenge Description" style="width: 500px; height: 500px">

We are provided a simple binary file which tells us if our input is the correct flag. Inspecting the file with Ghidra, we see the following:

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  size_t flag_length;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  uint seed;
  int i;
  int j;
  char input [72];
  long local_20;
  char elem;

  local_20 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  printf("Let me check your flag: ");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_0010213d,input);
  flag_length = strlen(input);
  if (flag_length != 63) {
    no();
  }
  seed = 1;
  i = 0;
  while( true ) {
    flag_length = strlen(input);
    if (flag_length <= (ulong)(long)i) break;
    seed = (int)input[i] * seed;
    i = i + 1;
  }
  srand(seed);
  j = 0;
  while( true ) {
    flag_length = strlen(input);
    if (flag_length <= (ulong)(long)j) break;
    elem = input[j];
    iVar1 = rand();
    if (((int)elem ^ iVar1 % 0x100) != *(uint *)(target + (long)j * 4)) {
      no();
    }
    j = j + 1;
  }
  puts("Correct!");
  if (local_20 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```

We can infer that the flag length is 63. The program computes a seed using the product of all the characters in our input, and feeds the seed into `srand`. Then, for each integer in the input, we generate a random integer using `rand()`, then perform XOR with the integer and take the least significant 8 bits. We then compare this to the corresponding element in `target`. We can verify that this is legitimate because every integer in `target` only has non-zero bits in its least significant 8 bits.

Following this, in order to find the flag, we have no choice but to find out what the seed is. Since `srand` uses a Linear Congruential Generator, and we know that the first 4 characters should be `TBTL`, we can determine what the seed should be. However, I opted to use a brute-force approach starting from the maximum possible value of the seed (`0xffffffff`) and reducing its value. At each seed value I would check if the first four xor values produced by the seed were correct. Below is my brute-force script:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <limits.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int target[63] = {0x33, 0x84, 0x3d, 0x3f, 0x2a, 0x93, 0x7b, 0x82, 0x1a, 0xac, 0x8e, 0xf4, 0xb1, 0xcb, 0x8d, 0x21, 0x0e, 0xb7, 0x67, 0x96, 0x2c, 0x81, 0xd3, 0xbc, 0x29, 0x6c, 0x4b, 0x0d, 0x00, 0xed, 0xfd, 0xee, 0x56, 0x40, 0x52, 0xd5, 0x05, 0x6d, 0x90, 0x3e, 0x7a, 0x1b, 0x69, 0x23, 0x1f, 0xb6, 0x1d, 0xbc, 0x98, 0xd1, 0xa6, 0x83, 0xe9, 0xeb, 0x13, 0x21, 0x3d, 0xf8, 0x2b, 0x79, 0x53, 0x4f, 0xa1};
    unsigned int seed = 0xffffffff;

    while (1) {
        // apply the seed to srand
        srand(seed);
        int a = rand();
        int b = rand();
        int c = rand();
        int d = rand();
        // check if the produced xor values are correct
        if (((0x54 ^ a % 0x100) == target[0]) && ((0x42 ^ b % 0x100) == target[1]) && ((0x52 ^ c % 0x100) == target[2]) && ((0x46 ^ d % 0x100) == target[3])) {
            printf("Seed found: %u\n", seed);
        }

        seed--;
        if (seed == 0) break;
    }
}
```

After a few minutes, I get the seed value which is `3797176037`. I can then make a solve script to solve for the flag:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
